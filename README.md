# deeperSpeech

Gathering audio data, using Librosa to extract audio features. A dataset of various audio features is then used to train a logistic regression algorithm. The goal is to classify human speech into one of two catagories; good or bad speaking skills. A k-means clustering algorithm was also created. Tensorflow was used to write the machine learning algorithms. The models are underfed, and do not achieve a satisfactory confidence value. The machine learning algorithms are effective but more work needs to be done to build a more uesful dataset.
